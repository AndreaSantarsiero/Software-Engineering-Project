# Galaxy Trucker - Software Engineering Project  

Galaxy Trucker is a board game where players take on the role of space truckers who build and pilot spaceships through dangerous intergalactic space. The game unfolds in several phases: ship construction, spaceflight, and managing challenges encountered along the way.

## Game Components  
- **Ship Boards**: Each player has a board on which they build their spaceship.  
- **Flight Board**: Indicates the route players will travel through space.  
- **Component Tiles**: Spaceship parts such as cabins, engines, cannons, shields, batteries, and cargo holds.  
- **Adventure Cards**: Events and dangers that players will face during the flight.  
- **Tokens**: Astronauts, aliens, batteries, goods, and cosmic credits.  
- **Dice**: Used to determine the outcome of events and attacks.

## Game Rules  

### 1. Construction Phase  
Players simultaneously assemble their ships by choosing component tiles from a common pile. The tiles must be correctly connected using the right connectors and must follow placement rules:  
- **Engines**: Must be placed at the back and have free space behind them.  
- **Cannons**: Must face outward and have no obstacles in front of them.  
- **Batteries**: Required to activate double cannons and double engines.  
- **Shields**: Protect against damage coming from specific directions.  
- **Cargo Holds**: Store goods collected during the flight.  

Players finish construction by placing their starting marker on the flight board.

### 2. Flight Phase  
During the flight, the leader (the player in the lead) draws and resolves adventure cards one by one. Possible events include:  
- **Planets**: Players can land to collect goods, but lose travel days.  
- **Abandoned Ships**: Offer cosmic credits in exchange for crew members.  
- **Space Stations**: Allow players to collect goods if they have enough crew.  
- **Smugglers, Pirates, and Slavers**: May attack players, steal goods, or inflict damage.  
- **Meteors**: Small meteors can be deflected by shields, while large ones must be destroyed by cannons.  
- **War Zone**: Penalizes players with less crew, engine power, or firepower.  

Ships can take damage, lose components, and become unusable if too damaged.

### 3. End of the Journey  
After resolving all adventure cards, cosmic credits are awarded based on:  
1. **Order of arrival**  
2. **Most beautiful ship** (fewest exposed connectors)  
3. **Value of transported goods**  
4. **Penalties for lost components**  

The player with the most cosmic credits wins the game!

## Advanced Mode  
Experienced players can take on higher-level flights with larger ships and more intense dangers. Available features include:  
- **Route Indications**: Allow better planning of ship construction.  
- **Life Support Modules**: Enable carrying aliens, who provide bonuses to engine power or firepower.  
- **Advanced Enemies**: Pirates and Slavers present greater challenges.  
- **Special Events**: Such as epidemics and sabotage that can compromise the journey.
