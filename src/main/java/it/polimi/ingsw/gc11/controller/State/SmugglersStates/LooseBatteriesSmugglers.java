/**
 * Adventure state used to handle the battery loss penalty associated with a {@code Smugglers} adventure card.
 *
 * <p>During this state, a specific player is required to discard a given number of batteries
 * from their ship. If the player does not select enough batteries, the state is repeated
 * until a valid selection is made or until the player has no batteries left.</p>
 *
 * <p>Once the penalty is successfully resolved or cannot be applied (due to insufficient batteries),
 * the game either proceeds to the next player or transitions to {@link IdleState} if all players
 * have resolved the card.</p>
 *
 * <h2>State Behavior Summary</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Validates the acting player.</li>
 *   <li>Checks whether the adventure card is already being resolved to avoid duplicate submissions.</li>
 *   <li>Handles both cases where the player has no batteries and where not enough batteries are selected.</li>
 *   <li>Updates the player's ship and advances the turn.</li>
 * </ul>
